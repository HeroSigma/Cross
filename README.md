# Pokémon Crossroads

**Pokémon Crossroads** is a ROM hack of *Pokémon Emerald* that unites the Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn regions into one epic adventure—essentially what a Game Freak remake of the game might look like if they combined these regions back in the day.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, please follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Project Details

This project is a fork of [**StrangeQuark's pokeemerald**](https://github.com/StrangeQuark/pokeemerald), which successfully merges the three regions into a single game. Additionally, it incorporates features from [**pokeemerald-expansion**](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion), a decompilation of *Pokémon Emerald* that includes several quality-of-life improvements.
